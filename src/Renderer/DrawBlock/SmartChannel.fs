/// HLP23: suggested initial smartChannel top-level function
/// to be tested, it must be given a channel in through which to route wires nicely
/// Normally the channel will come from symbol edges.
/// The function must identify all wires with segments going through the channel and space them
/// This function routes the middle segment of all 7 segment wires by moving them perpendicular to its direction.
/// It is expected that all wires provided are 7 segment with middle segment in the same direction
/// wires not so will be ignored.
/// The messiness of when to call it, what to do with different types of wire, which wires to call it with
/// could be left till later.
/// For this simple routing only one dimension of the channel is needed (determined by orientation).
/// The Wires going through the channel must be returned as an updated Wires map in model.

/// Some helpers which are lower in compiler order
